# NYMToDO
This is a very simple todo app. It in itself is not very impressive, especially given other projects I have created and worked on. What makes this project impressive to myself personally, is that is serves as a "capstone" or POC for a four part project series I have been working on.

## The Why:
I decided to dive into Go to refactor the back end of my Photo sharing app, Little Moments. I really enjoyed the experience of working in Go, and things felt like they were really clicking. I decided to embark on this journey to further my understand of both Go, computer science conepts, HTTP, and DSA. I chose to do a four part project. The project consisted of:

1. A simple HTTP framework built on top of Go's 1.22+ `net/http` library.
2. A simple KV data store built with with Go
3. A simple reverse proxy built with Go
4. A capstone simple web app built with the three previously mentioned projects

So NYMToDo is this POC/capstone project. It's just a simple Todo app on the surface, but it's core is a combination of multiple projects I built to further my undersanding. It was a fun project that had some headaches along the way. It was definitely worth the struggle, and I learned a lot.
